"Deal or No Deal: Text" text based game of the popular "Deal or No Deal" television game show.  The player chooses a case on display to knock amounts of money off the board, until the user is left with one case. The case will contain how much money the player can win.  In any given round, the user can take another monetary deal from the Banker.

Description of the project. Be sure to explain how you plan to use
elements of Unix design philosophy to implement the project.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

Unix Philosophy:

Rule of Modularity: The "Deal or No Deal" game is complex, but when split into small parts, is very simple. We used the Rule of Modularity to implement the project by making methods that eventually intertwine within a "main". In order to build a good project, it needs to have a strong fundamental.

Rule of Transparency: Since three people are working on this project, it was imperative that we had good coding design. It would waste time if every time one of us pulled from the remote, we had to reread and recomprehend the code. Therefore, we focused on simplicity and coding design principles to help each other. 

Rule of Least Surprise: We're not trying to do anything fancy. Sure, once we put all the small parts of our project together it looks fancy, but the fundamental is basic. There's no need to use fancy code or style, since either way, we have one result. 

Rule of Generation: It was important to us to make methods that did work for us, because every round of our game is very similar, with some changes. Instead of changing the code every round, we can use the same code but throw in different parameters. 

Rule of Optimization: When we first started the game, we made sure that the general game play algorithm worked before adding in features such as a display and extra text calls. It is important to do this so that you don't run into bigger problems that can only be fixed by stepping backwards.
